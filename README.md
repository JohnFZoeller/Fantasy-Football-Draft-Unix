# Personal---FantasyFootballDrafter

The goal here is going to be to make a fantasy football draft machine that runs on the command line.   This is going
to be really similar to other fantasy football draft machines such as ESPN's or YAHOO's.

I NEED to make this for a few reasons:

A) My operating systems professor has a super boring voice and my fantasy football draft is coming up. 
B) I cant run ESPN's draft on my computer during class because my laptop is 9 years old and the fan 
        starts freaking out everytime I open a draft. 
C) I want to be able to simulate entire drafts in less than a few minutes. If I make my own program I can adjust how fast the draft goes.
